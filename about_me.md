    <p> Hi, I am Gyu Kim. I was born and raised in South Korea. My original Korean first name is Gyuhyeon (규현), but I go by Gyu because people often struggle to make the correct pronunciation. (Sounds like gyu in Wagyu beef instead of Guy-u) I finished my bachelor's degree in Chemistry at Seoul National University in Seoul, South Korea, with a minor in Biological Science. Back then, I was more interested in studying human biology, but didn't really know what the full-time research life looked like. So, I worked as a research technician in <a href="https://pellmanlab.dana-farber.org/" target="_blank">the Pellman lab</a> at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston with an amazing science mentor, Kathleen Xie. I studied validating the association between cell nuclear rupture and DNA damage to show that nuclear rupture does not cause any significant DNA damage, which is against what has been reported in the field, using live-cell tracking confocal imaging and automated high-throughput image quantification software. (Waiting to be published someday) </p>
    
    <p> In 2021, I joined the Biochemistry PhD Program at Stanford University and joined the Khavari lab in my second year. Here, I gain an interest in working on data-driven research with machine learning to understand the complex dimensional problems in biology invisible at a simple glance. I kicked off my computer science and statistics journey by taking coursework and working on a project. I am actively working on modeling gene regulation using transcription factor binding data and understanding the nonconsensus binding of transcription factors. I am most excited about delivering the "interpretable" biological knowledge through machine learning beyond building a good predictive model. I am highly interested in learning more about the theory behind the causal inference and discovery techniques and applying those to molecular biology questions to better understand the causal relationship among biological factors during gene regulation.</p>  
    
    <p> Outside of science, I love strolling around the grocery store. (Trader Joe's, Costco are my two favorites. Apology for Whole Foods fans), exploring different local restaurants and coffee places, and watching TV shows (The Office, Parks and Recs, Modern Family are my top shows) in my free time with occasional F45 workout.</p>

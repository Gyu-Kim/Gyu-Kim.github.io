Hi, I am Gyu Kim. I was born and raised in South Korea. My original first Korean name is Gyuhyeon (규현), but I go by Gyu because people often struggled to making a correct pronunciation :).
I finished my bachelor degree in Chemistry at Seoul National University in Seoul, South Korea with minor in Biological Science. After that, I worked as a research technician in [the Pellman lab](https://pellmanlab.dana-farber.org/) at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston with an amazing science mentor Kathleen Xie.
I studied the causal relationship between cell nuclear rupture and DNA damage to show that nulear rupture does not cause any significant DNA damage using live-cell tracking confocal imaging and automated high-throughput image quantification software. (Waiting to be published) 

In 2021, I joined Biochemistry PhD Program at Stanford University and joined the Khavari lab in my second year. Here, I gain an interest of working on data-driven research with machine learning model to understand the complex dimensional problems in biology invisible by simple look. 
I kicked off my computer science and statistics journey by taking coursework and working on the project. I am actively working on modeling gene regulation using transcription factor binding data, and understanding the nonconsensus binding of transcription factors. I am most excited about delivering the "interpretable" biological knowledge through machine learning beyond building the good predictive model. 
I am highly interests in learning more about the theory behind the causal inference and discovery techniques and applying those on molecular biology question to better understand the casuality relationship among biological factors during gene regulation.  

Outside of science, I love strolling around the grocery shop. (Trader Joe's, Costco are my two favorite. Apology for Whole Food fans) Exploring different local restaurants and coffee places, and watching TV shows (The office, Park and Recs, Modern Family are my top shows) on my free time with occassional F45 workout.

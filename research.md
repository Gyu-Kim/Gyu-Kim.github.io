        Transcription factors (TFs) are the key trans-acting elements of gene expression. However, the quantitative contributions of their activities on gene expression still remain unclear due to the complex combinatorial actions of TFs. Recent literature on sequence-trained models (Puffin and EVO-2) showed some exemplary cases of modeling genetic properties from the pure sequence. However, the motif-based inferences are often discordant with the physical binding of transcription factors. We...

  II. Comprehensive Characterization of Non-consensus Binding Incidences of Human Transcription Factors in vivo
</p>

<!-- Italic question -->
<p style="font-style: italic; margin-top: 0.5em;">
  "What's the scope of non-consensus binding of transcription factors?"<br>
  "Can we better understand the factors mediating those non-consensus binding events?"

    <p> Transcription factors (TF) are the key trans-acting elements of gene expression. However, the quantitative contributions of their activities on gene expression still remain unclear due to the complex combinatorial actions of TF on each gene. Recent literature on sequence-trained models (Puffin and EVO-2) showed some exemplary cases of modeling genetic properties from the pure sequence. However, the motif-based inferences are often discordant with the physical binding of transcription factors and are missing the dynamic range of TF binding intensities. In this project, we are building a highly accurate predictive and interpretable model of transcription activity using only a few sets of transcription factor binding data and inferring the TF and gene expression relationship using SHAP interpretation. </p>

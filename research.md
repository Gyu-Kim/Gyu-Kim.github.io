    <p> Hi, I am Gyu Kim. I was born and raised in South Korea. My original Korean first name is Gyuhyeon (규현), but I go by Gyu because people often struggle to make the correct pronunciation. (Sounds like gyu in Wagyu beef instead of Guy-u) I finished my bachelor's degree in Chemistry at Seoul National University in Seoul, South Korea, with a minor in Biological Science. Back then, I was more interested in studying human biology, but didn't really know what the full-time research life looked like. So, I worked as a research technician in <a href="https://pellmanlab.dana-farber.org/" target="_blank">the Pellman lab</a> at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston with an amazing science mentor, Kathleen Xie. I studied validating the association between cell nuclear rupture and DNA damage to show that nuclear rupture does not cause any significant DNA damage, which is against what has been reported in the field, using live-cell tracking confocal imaging and automated high-throughput image quantification software. (Waiting to be published someday) </p>

      Transcription factors (TF) are the key trans-acting elements of gene expression. However, the quantitative contributions of their activities on gene expression still remain unclear due to the complex combinatorial actions of TF on each gene. Recent literature on sequence-trained models (Puffin and EVO-2) showed some exemplary cases of modeling genetic properties from the pure sequence. However, the motif-based inferences are often discordant with the physical binding of transcription factors and are missing the dynamic range of TF binding intensities. In this project, we are building a highly accurate predictive and interpretable model of transcription activity using only a few sets of transcription factor binding data and inferring the TF and gene expression relationship using SHAP interpretation.

  II. Comprehensive Characterization of Non-consensus Binding of Human Transcription Factors
</p>

<!-- Italic question -->
<p style="font-style: italic; margin-top: 0.5em;">
  "What's the scope of non-consensus binding of transcription factors?"<br>
  "Can we better understand the factors mediating those non-consensus binding events?"

      Recent machine learning work in genomics fields often defines the effectors based on motif inference. However, there have been consistent observations from the literature about non-consensus binding of transcription factors, the binding happening without a known motif. This project aims to provide a comprehensive quantitative scope of non-consensus binding and characterize the patterns of those incidences using machine learning with a large-scale ENCODE dataset.

    Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) accounts for 20% of all skin cancer mortality globally, making it the second-highest subtype of skin cancer.  By performing pseudobulk analysis of single-cell sequencing data from normal and cSCC human skin tissues, we determined a global portfolio of lncRNAs specifically expressed in keratinocyte subpopulations. Integration of CRISPR interference screens in vitro and the xenograft model identified several lncRNAs impacting the growth of cSCC cancer lines in vitro and in vivo. Among these, we further validated LINC00704 and LINC01116 as proliferation-regulating lncRNAs in cSCC lines and potential biomarkers of cSCC growth.

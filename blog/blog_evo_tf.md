  <h1>Evolutionary perspective on transcription factors (on update)</h1>

  <p>Every living organism with DNA genome needs a way to control gene expressions. Transcription factors (TFs) are the widely known main effectors on this process. How these factors have been evolved around different branch of the living organisms has been always intriguing aspects for me. Kribelbauer et al., the review article about low affinity TF binding, provided a good summary perspective about TF in prokaryotic and eukaryotic system.</p>

  <p>The numeric aspect of TFs is an interesting angle to consider. Different organisms have different number of TF. While the length of DNA binding domain are similar, eukaryotic organisms tend to have more and diverse domain structures of TFs than prokaryotic, which makes sense that Eukaryotic organisms tend to have larger sizes and more complicated biochemical structures of genome and regulation process. But even among eukaryotic organisms, the sizes of genomes and the number of TFs varied a lot. Plants tend to have more TF per gene than animal. For example, maize has a putative ~2,500 TF (2.3Gb genome) while human has ~1,600 TF (3.3Gb genome). Arabidopsis, one of the most popular plant model organisms are known to have 1800~2000 TF which is comparable to the number of human TF set while the genome size is only 3%, 0.135Gb, of human genome. So, itâ€™s been well taken observation that genome size and the number of TFs is not well correlated.</p>

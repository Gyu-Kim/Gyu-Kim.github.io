Hello world! My name is Gyu (he/him) and I am a Biochemistry PhD candidate in <a href="https://khavarilab.stanford.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Khavari lab</a> at Stanford University. I am also a Computer Science PhD Minor candidate on AI/ML track. I am interested in modeling the complex space of molecular biology and making an interpretable and meaningful biological discovery through analysis and model interpretation. I am actively working on understanding the association between gene regulation and transcription factors, and nonconsensus binding of transcription factors using ML modeling, and broadly interested in causal and interpretable ML using bioloigical data. Previously, I completed by BS in Chemistry and Biology at Seoul National University in South Korea, and worked in David Pellman lab at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School as a research technician studying cell nuclear rupture and DNA damage.

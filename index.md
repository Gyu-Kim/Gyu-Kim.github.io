Hello! I am a Biochemistry PhD candidate in [Khavari lab](https://khavarilab.stanford.edu/) at Stanford University, the school of Medicine. I am also in the Computer Science PhD Minor track focused on Machine Learning. 
I am interested in modeling the complex space of molecular biology and making an interpretable and meaningful biological discovery through analysis and model interpretation. I am actively working on understanding the association between gene regulation and transcription factors, and nonconsensus binding of transcription factors using ML modeling.
